**Hello World!**

I am Anukriti hailing from New Delhi, India currently pursuing my Bachelors degree in Information Technology from Delhi Technological University (Formerly Delhi College of Engineering), Delhi. 

	This is my first ever Blog! I am elated to share that I am going to spend this summer as an outreachy intern 2020 with the OCaml community and hence, I am penning this blog to describe my journey so far and the entire selection process. I hope the future Outreachy aspirants would be benefitted by knowing about Outreachy and its rich culture. 
    
Happy Reading!

##  The Motivation

On the very first day of induction in University, a counselling session was organized by our seniors and we were given insights about life in an engineering college and various prestigious programs that engineering students dream to pursue, especially those from the field of Computers Sciences and Information Technology. This was the day when I got to know all about open source contributions for the very first time and it led to a very positive impact in my life.

	Outreachy is one such platform where you get an opportunity to contribute to open source software remotely through a 3 month long paid internship to hone your capabilities and explore your potential. This program is offered twice a year and the best part is that you need not have to be a student to apply for it. Here, the interns get to learn from some of the most skilled and talented mentors and are paid a decent stipend of $5,500 with a $500 travel grant to attend any national or international event or seminar related to their project subject to the approval of their mentors.

##  Initial Application

It's the very first step in the application process!
In the month of February, I filled my initial application which asked for my mandatory personal information, time commitments and also a few essay answers each asking for the importance and urge of getting selected as an intern. After filling it, it was a month long wait after which one fine day, I finally received a mail regarding the acceptance of my initial application and then I was all set for my next steps. So, keep reading to get more insights!

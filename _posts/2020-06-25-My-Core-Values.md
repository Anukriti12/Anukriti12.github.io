# "VALUES ARE LIKE FINGERPRINTS. NOBODYs ARE THE SAME BUT YOU LEAVE THEM ALL OVER EVERYTHING YOU DO!"
    
Core values are those traits or qualities that are not just worthwhile but they also represent an individual's highest priorities, deeply held beliefs, and core, fundamental driving forces. These are the guiding principles as they form a solid core of who you are, what you believe, and who you are and want to be going forward.

In this blog, I will be penning down some of my core values and why they are so important to me. So, if I were to choose my top 3 core values, it would include Curiosity, Hard Work and Growth.

## CURIOSITY

I believe it is the most important attitude one must possess as it is this state of active interest only which allows one to embrace unfamiliar circumstances, giving an opportunity to experience discovery and joy. One can never learn unless he/she has the eagerness for it. 

For those looking for guidance, this is the best advice I could give you:

### 'Just focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible'


## HARD WORK

Now by this core value, I didn’t refer to being busy just for the sake of working. Rather, I am advocating for the importance of doing our own work in a more focused and deliberate way, putting our whole self into it. Doing the best you can, to accomplish the most you can, with the one life you’ve got. I personally enjoy working as it gives me a lot of happiness and joy in it. And I believe, without a doubt in my mind, those who feel the most fulfilled at the end of their lives are those who have chosen to work hard during it.


## GROWTH

It is the essence of life. By growth, I meant not to be stagnant in life. According to me, growth and development is a continuous process and stops only when we choose for it. It is very important to structure daily activities in such a way that consistency and discipline is still maintained and this can ultimately help achieve our goals. So, just reflect on what is working well for you and what isn’t based on which one should be able to adapt accordingly.


So, these were some of my core values. I hope you all liked it and stay connected for more such blogs in future!

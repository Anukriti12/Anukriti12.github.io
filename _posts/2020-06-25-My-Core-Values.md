	VALUES ARE LIKE FINGERPRINTS. NOBODYs ARE THE SAME BUT YOU LEAVE THEM ALL OVER EVERYTHING YOU DO!
    
Core values are those traits or qualities that are not just worthwhile but they also represent an individual's highest priorities, deeply held beliefs, and core, fundamental driving forces. These are the guiding principles as they form a solid core of who you are, what you believe, and who you are and want to be going forward.

In this blog, I will be penning down some of my core values and why they are so important to me. So, if I were to choose my top 3 core values, it would include Curiosity, Hard Work and Growth.

## CURIOSITY
I believe it is the most important attitude one must possess as it is this state of active interest only which allows one to embrace unfamiliar circumstances, giving an opportunity to experience discovery and joy. One can never learn unless he/she has the eagerness for it. 

For those looking for guidance, this is the best advice I could give you:

	Just focus on making choices to lead your life that aligns with your core values in the most purposeful way possible
